# This is a classic workaround in the Wayland + Hyprland + xdg-desktop-portal world. 
# Here's why that matters:
#
# This script fixes broken or non-working xdg-desktop-portal behavior, like:
# - Screen sharing not working in browsers or OBS
# - Flatpak apps not opening file dialogs
# - General portal weirdness on startup
#
# The script force-kills any running portal services. 
# Sometimes, the wrong backend (like `wlr`) gets auto-started, or portals start 
# too early, before the Wayland session is fully ready. That leads to broken 
# integration. 
# Then manually start the correct backend (hyprland), give it a moment to 
# initialize, and start the main xdg-desktop-portal service last â€” ensuring the 
# right portal backend is chosen and things work properly.
#
# When do you need this?
# - You're on Hyprland, but apps are using the wlr backend by mistake
# - Flatpak apps aren't integrating properly
# - Screen sharing or file dialogs just don't work
# - You see this in logs: No backend implementation available

# To check what portal backend is being used:
# echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
# journalctl | grep xdg-desktop-portal
